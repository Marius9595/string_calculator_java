# string_calculator_java

In this kata you have to code a program that takes an expression that contains numbers and calculate a sum of them.

` 
int Add(string expression)
`

This one should handle the next stuff:
* `"" -> 0`
* `"1" -> 1` 
* `"1,2,3,4" -> 10` 
* `“1\n2,3” ->  6`
* `“1,\n” -> ERROR`
* `“//;\n1;2” -> 3` 
* `“negatives not allowed”`
* `"1001,2" -> 2` 
* `“//[;;;]/n2;;;2;;;3” -> 7` 
* `“//[;][%]\n1;2%3” -> 6` 
* `“//[;;;;][;%]\n3;;;2;%3” -> 8`
